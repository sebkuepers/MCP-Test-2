# MCP-Test-2 Repository

This is a test repository created to demonstrate MCP functionality.

## Test Message

Hello, world! This README was created using the GitHub API through MCP.

## Recommended MCP Servers

For enhanced functionality when working with AI assistants, we recommend using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. These servers enable AI assistants to perform specific tasks through standardized APIs.

### GitHub MCP Server

The [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) is particularly useful for this template, providing capabilities such as:

- Repository management (create, fork, clone)
- File operations (create, update, delete)
- Issue and PR management
- Code search functionality
- Branch management

To set up the GitHub MCP Server:

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions
2. Configure the server in your environment

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [GitHub MCP Server documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github).
